<h1><b>SMD Resistors Code Calculator!</b></h1>
  So, this is basic SMD resistors code calculator. You just enter resistor code, press 'Calculate' button or Enter button, and you can see resistor resistance.

It can calculate all of resistors code types, like, 3 digits, 4 digits, EIA96, and R+digits

<h3>Kivy version</h3>
I am also revrited this project using Kivy instead Tkinter, to build an APK file for Android. Repository of Kivy-based version you can find here:

- [kivy-smd-calc](https://github.com/so1der/kivy-smd-calc)


<h3>EIA96</h3>

  EIA96 was the main reason for me to create this calculator. Its just pointless random table, which you cant just calculate in your head, without looking into table, unlike all other code types. You can see below, that codes and values not connected in any way, you can just remember letters with multiplers, so you can know roughly how much resistance there is, but thats not the point
